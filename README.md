# Everyone Is John
_This is a React reimplementation of the original web client by Vynlar (https://github.com/Vynlar/Everyone-is-John)_

## Overview
Everyone Is John is a freeform RPG where everyone controls the same character. The rules can be found [here](https://1d4chan.org/images/7/70/EVERYONE_IS_JOHN.png).

This app in particular is a web based client allowing players to easily setup, manage, and play games with their friends via skype, or even just to use as a point tracking system in person.

## Installation
Clone down the repository and install dependencies with `npm install`

## Running Tests
Run tests with `npm test`. This will lint the code before running tests. If any style violations are found, the tests will not run and the process will exit with a non-0 status code. Testing uses the [jest](https://jestjs.io) test runner.

## Running The App
Start the app with `npm start`. By default it will run in development, with hot-reloading using WebpackDevMiddleware. To run in production, set `NODE_ENV=production`. The app will run on port `3000` by default.

## Running The Linter
The linter can be run with `npm run lint`. We are using the [xo](https://github.com/xojs/xo) linter for code styling guidelines.

## Contributing
Feel free to pick up any issues and submit a PR for them. Please do not submit PRs that fail to address a specific issue. **Note:** When committing, the linter will run. Commits will be denied at the time of commit if there are any code style violations.
